    <h3>Working hard and getting better day by day</h3>
    <p>In this day and age, having a perticular skillset is a must.
        I always had curiosity about websites.
        That's why I have chosen to learn web development.

        <h3>Becoming a full stack Web Dev</h3>
        <p>I am currently on CSS and learning Tailwind CSS. Then I plan on moving to the basics of JS and then quickly move on to ReactJS.
        I am planning to learn the MERN stack. I can make you a website using wordpress and some other tools online,
        and I am a parttime copywriter now. If you wanna know more please contact me. We'll have a virtual coffee together. Cheers!

    <h2>Learning Web Development</h2>
    <h3> 2022-present | Programming Hero Learner | 
    </h3>
     <p>They didn't offer me a job. <br> But I made myself as a remove web developer.
    I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content.
    It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
